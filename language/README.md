## Language


### Addressing users

- Your UI should address the user using either:

  - **Second person, “you” or “your”**: Use this conversational style for most situations, as though the app is speaking directly to the user.

    ```
    Quickly open the camera without unlocking your screen

    Your places
    ```

  - **First person, “I” or “my”**: In some cases, you may need to use this form of address to emphasize the user's ownership of content or actions.

    ```
    I agree to follow the Google Terms of Service

    My Account
    ```


- Avoid mixing "me"/"my" with "you"/"your.”

  > Why? It can cause confusion to see both forms of addressing the user in the same context.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  Change your preferences in My Account
  ```
  
  
### Avoid the pronoun "we"


- Focus on the user and what they can do with your app, rather than what you or your app is doing for the user.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  To get you started, we’re showing you the most popular posts this week
  
  /* good */
  Get started with these popular posts
  ```
  
  - **Note:** One exception is when a person takes an action for a user, such as reviewing an appeal or responding to a suggestion. Here, the use of “we” is appropriate.
  
    ```
    /* avoid */
    Your appeal will be reviewed, and you will receive a response within a few days
    
    /* good */
    We’ll review your appeal and respond within a few days
    ```
