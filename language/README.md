### Addressing users

Your UI should address the user using either:

- **Second person, “you” or “your”**: Use this conversational style for most situations, as though the app is speaking directly to the user.
  
  ```
  Quickly open the camera without unlocking your screen

  Your places
  ```

- **First person, “I” or “my”**: In some cases, you may need to use this form of address to emphasize the user's ownership of content or actions.

  ```
  I agree to follow the Google Terms of Service

  My Account
  ```
  

Avoid mixing "me"/"my" with "you"/"your.”

  > Why? It can cause confusion to see both forms of addressing the user in the same context.

  ```
  /* avoid */
  Change your preferences in My Account
  ```
