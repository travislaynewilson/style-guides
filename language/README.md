### Addressing users

Your UI may address the user using either:

- *Second person, “you” or “your”*: Use this conversational style for most situations, as though the app is speaking directly to the user.

- *First person, “I” or “my”*: In some cases, you may need to use this form of address to emphasize the user's ownership of content or actions.
